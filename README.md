1.) The purpose of this repository is to keep all the big projects I have worked on this semester in Web Programming.

2.) My favorite project was MBTA because it taught me how to use API's. And by learning how to use API's, I found practical use for web programming for my future projects.

3.) I believe that I have grown as a programmer immensely. Knowing the basic blueprint of the web, I have a better understanding of what is going when I do anything on a internet browsers.

4.) The most important thing I've learned this course is the 3-Way Handshake and how to use web API's. 3-Way Handshake is applicable anytime when I request something from the web and get a response back. Web API's is applicable when I want to create a new project, using a dataset from a web domain.

5.) I'd like to explore more into web security. However, I dislike the fact that there are so many unknown components involved in web programming.
