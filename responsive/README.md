All aspects of the assigment have been correctly implemented.

I did not collaborate or discusse with anyone on this assignment.

This project took me an hour.

I had a little trouble with pushing my files into the respository.
I attempted to commit multiple times, but I was greeted with an error
message, "On branch master nothing to commit, working directory clean."
I've visited the TA and solved to issue by using "git push -u origin master"
which pushed everything within the file. Sorry about little to no commits.
