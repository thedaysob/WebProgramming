All the aspects of the assignment have been implemented correctly.

I have not collaborated with anyone on this assignment.

I spent about 5 to 10 hours on this assignment.

As you can see, I have not commited many times to the repository. I had
a github bug that I could not solve. I kept receiving "On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean" when I tried to git add and git push. 
Therefore, for the time being, I just progressed on to finishing the mbta code.
Eventually with the help of Juliana, I solved the error and commited and pushed to the
repository.
I understand that points will be deducted for not commiting regularly. But
I thought you know.
