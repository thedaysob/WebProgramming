All the aspects of the assignment have been implemented correctly.

I have not collaborated with anyone on this assignment.

I spent about 5 to 10 hours on this assignment.

As you can see, my git log is a mess. I encountered a github bug 
after my first commit that I could not solve. I kept receiving 
"On branch master nothing to commit, working tree clean" when 
I tried to git add and git push. Therefore, for the time being, 
I just progressed on to finishing the mbta code. Eventually with 
the help of Juliana, I solved the error and commited and pushed to 
the repository as I would have without the bug. I understand that if 
you are going to deduct points for not commiting regularly. 
But I thought you should know.
